version 1.2.0-release (2022-02-19)
	
	- binary file can now be generated from libassemblyline 
	  with asm_create_bin_file()

	- reformatted man page for wide screen

	- added support for all operand encodings for and, or, xor, sub, and add
	  instructions

	- added support for all setcc instructions - set byte on condition

	- added a command-line option in asmline for setting 
	  assembly mode to NASM '$ asmline --nasm-sib-no-base' where:
      in SIB addressing if there is no base register present and scale is equal to 2; 
      the base register will be set to the index register and the scale will be reduced to 1.
      That is: "lea r15, [2*rax]" -> "lea r15, [rax+1*rax]" -> 4c 8d 3c 00

	- added a command-line option in asmline for setting 
	  assembly mode to STRICT '$ asmline --strict-sib-no-base' where:
	  in SIB addressing when there is no base register present the index and scale would
	  not change regardless of scale value.  
      That is: "lea r15, [2*rax]" -> "lea r15, [2*rax]" -> 4c 8d 3c 45 00 00 00 00


version 1.1.0-release (2022-01-21)

	- added support for scaled index addressing mode
	  with syntax [base + scale*index + offset] or
	  [base + index*scale + offset]
	  ex: "add rax, [rcx+4*rbp+0x8]" or "add rax, [rcx+rbp*4+0x8]"

	- added support for MMX, SSE2, AVX, and AVX2 instruction sets

	- added support for pointers: byte, word, dword, and qword  

	- added support for `mov [MEM], IMM` such as `mov [rsi], "0xADE1A1DE"`
	
	- added different modes of register size handling for 
	  "mov register, immediate" instruction: NASM, STRICT, SMART

	- improved 32-bit register supportability:
	  using eax-r15b for memory addressing in vector extension now 
	  produces the correct prefix (67H)
	
	- improved intel x86_64 instruction supportability:
	  source code is now more inline with the intel manual, therefore
	  more instructions can be supported in the near future

	- added a command-line option in asmline for setting 
	  assembly mode to NASM '$ asmline -n' where:
	  if immediate size for mov is less than or equal to max signed 32-bit
	  asmline will emit code to mov to 32-bit register rather than 64-bit.
	  That is: "mov rax, 0x7fffffff" as "mov eax, 0x7fffffff" -> b8 ff ff ff 7f
	  note: rax got optimized to eax for faster immediate to register transfer and
	  produces a shorter instruction. 

	- added a command-line option in asmline for setting 
	  assembly mode to STRICT '$ asmline -t' where:  
	  ex: even if immediate size for mov is less than or equal to max signed 32-bit
	  pad the immediate to fit 64bit.
	  That is: "mov rax,0x7fffffff" as "mov rax,0x000000007fffffff" 
	    -> 48 b8 ff ff ff 7f 00 00 00 00

	- added a command-line option in asmline for setting  
	  assembly mode to SMART '$ asmline -s' where:  
	  asmline will check the immediate value for leading 0's and thus allows manual
	  optimizations. Immediate must be zero padded to 64-bits exactly to ensure 
	  it will not optimize. This is currently set as default.
	  ex: "mov rax, 0x000000007fffffff" ->  48 b8 ff ff ff 7f 00 00 00 00
	      "mov rax, 0x7fffffff"         ->  b8 ff ff ff 7f

	- assemblyline functions without asm_ prefix are now deprecated

	- simplified the process for adding new instructions
	
	- improvements to autotools, including use of pkg-config. That enables
	  other autotools-based projects to include assemblyline as such:
	  add to their `configure.ac`:
	  ```
		AC_SUBST([LIBASSEMBLYLINE_CFLAGS])
		AC_SUBST([LIBASSEMBLYLINE_LIBS])
		PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBASSEMBLYLINE], [assemblyline >= 1.1.0])
	  ```

	- tools/asmline dynamically links to libassemblyline.so

	- tools/asmline's -r[=LEN] option now runs with six arguments, which point
	  to heap-memory. Each argumenty points to LEN (defaults to ten) 64-bit
	  elements. It also features now --rand, which initializes those pointers to
	  random data.

	- added `asmline 1` man-page

	- added man-pages for all the functions from libassemblyline (same content
	  as libassemblyline)
