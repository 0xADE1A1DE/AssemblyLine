version 1.1.0-release (2021-12-24)

	- added support for scaled index addressing mode
	  with syntax [base + scale*index + offset] or
	  [base + index*scale + offset]
	  ex: "add rax, [rcx+4*rbp+0x8]" or "add rax, [rcx+rbp*4+0x8]"

	- added support for MMX, SSE2, AVX, and AVX2 instruction sets  
	
	- added different modes of register size handling for 
	  "mov register, immediate" instruction 
	
	- improved 32-bit register supportability:
	  using eax-r15b for memory addressing in vector extension now 
	  produces the correct prefix (67H)
	
	- improved intel x86_64 instruction supportability:
	  source code is now more inline with the intel manual, therefore
	  more instructions can be supported in the near future

	- added a new command-line option in asmline for printing 
	  machine code output to a file using '$ asmline -p' 
	
	- simplified the process for adding new instructions
	
	- improvements to autotools

	  to match nasm assembly style
	
	- added man page
	
	- added -v -h options to asmline
